## 🚫 COMMIT POLICY
**CRITICAL: Never create commits without explicit user authorization.**
- Always ask for permission before running `git commit`
- Wait for explicit approval from the user before making any commits
- Do not automatically commit changes after completing tasks
- Respect the user's control over version history
- Only commit when the user explicitly says "commit approved" or similar
